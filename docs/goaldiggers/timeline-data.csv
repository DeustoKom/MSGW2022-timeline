This allows the terminally and gravely ill to request help to die with dignity, without having to leave the country which was what was quite often practiced previously. With this ruling, Germany will help those suffering and extremely ill, to end their lives in an organized manner with the help of medical practitioners. 
Germany’s hightest court concluded the right to die includes the freedom to “rely on the voluntary help of another person.”

The official results were announced on 6 November 2020, and the law came into effect a year later, in November 2021. This law only applies to citizens and permanent residents of New Zealand who are over the age of 18. They must be terminally ill with 6 months or less to live. The patient has to be in an ""advanced state of irreversible decline in physical capability"" with ""unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that the person considers tolerable."" Lastly, it is essential that the patient is able to make an informed decision regarding the assisted death. </p>",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/587E/production/_109645622_mediaitem109645621.jpg,BBC News,Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern supports the euthanasia reform,,picture,,,
2021,6,25,,2021,6,25,,,<span style='color:#21468c;'>Spain legalizes euthanasia</span>,"<p> On 25 June 2021, Spain became the fifth country in the world and the fourth in Europe to legalise euthanasia. Spain joined the likes of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Canada, in passing the law. The requirements for patients to request their life be ended, are that the affected person must “suffer a serious or incurable disease or a serious, chronic and incapacitating condition,” which causes them “intolerable suffering.”
However, unlike the laws in force in other countries, the Spanish legislation sets out a thorough series of steps that could result in the process taking a month from the patients date of request. The process starts with a written request by the patient and it must be submitted twice over the space of two weeks to ensure the decision has been thought about extensively. The patient is allowed to change their mind at any time and once the second request has be made, the patient’s doctor must allow for and pass the request onto the regional commission. They will then approve or reject the decision based on the circumstances. 

Before the passing of this law, helping somebody to die in Spain was potentially punishable by a jail term of up to 10 years. Now suffering patients are legally given the option. </p>
