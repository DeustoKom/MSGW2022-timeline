But when she returned to Italy, her university refused to validate the exams she had done abroad. Corradi then decided to look for signatures by dozens of firms to get the compatibility of studies in the world.

2022,5,22,,,,,,,Advantages: Traveling,"<p> You have the chance to get to know places you have never been before and the culture of that place. Walking through the streets, which have a lot of history. You also get to experience this with the people you get to meet on the Erasmus programme.

2022,5,24,,,,,,,Advanatges: Language,"<p> The Erasmus experience gives you the opportunity to first, learn or improve if you already have knowledge about a language. Having a language to add to your resume is always welcomed, as it can improve your chances to one day land on a job application and even get that job. That same logic can be applied to internships, where you can show what you know, and then we begin with the circle of opportunities. </p>",https://danivoiceovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DVO_photo-750x500.png,"<a href=""https://danivoiceovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DVO_photo-750x500.png"">Dani Voice Overs</a>",Languages,,,,,
2022,5,25,,,,,,,Disadvantages: Financial struggles,"<p> Erasmus program provides an amount of money; the amount depends on the country you're going to, but it can really help. Most of the time this money only covers your rent and for the other expenses of living, you have to cover this yourself. When you are in a new culture you want to experience it all, and will most likely be pricey. Think of all the trips, partying and food you are going to buy. It is best to prepare yourself for these expenses. </p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsjedV1u_ZY,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/ByMagdaYT"">ByMagda</a>","<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsjedV1u_ZY"">Tips on how to save money during Erasmus</a>",,,,,
2022,5,26,,,,,,,Disadvantages: Tourist phase,"<p> The Honeymoon phase. When you first arrive in a country, everything looks magical and amazing. You will endure most of the annoying things and focus on the magical part because everything is so new and bright. Later on you will realise that you're living in a new place. Everything that seemed so nice, can now annoy you and it has lost its sparkle. After a while you will start to settle down, and experience the country for what it is. When you have accepted all the bad things, you will start enjoying your stay again. </p>",https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/004/112/272/original/culture-shock-after-change-new-job-or-new-colleagues-surprised-by-different-cultural-or-language-weird-people-concept-frustrated-businessman-facing-culture-shock-after-change-to-new-office-vector.jpg,,,,,,,
2022,5,27,,,,,,,Disadvantages: High expectations,"<p> You shouldn't rely your happiness on a country you will move to, because it is not enough. If you want to move abroad and leave your problems behind, spoiler alert! You won't be able to do that. Problems don't have borders, don't expect a new country to magically make it disappear. So one of the most important things to remember is you have to work for your happiness; don't expect it to happen by itself.  </p>","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/247a82_0399dcd9a88645ebb6ee1ab8aae1e774~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/247a82_0399dcd9a88645ebb6ee1ab8aae1e774~mv2.jpg",,,,,,,
