1952,12,5,,1952,12,9,,,The Londonâ€™s Killer Fog,"<p>London was one of the nations that influenced the industrialization market during the Industrial Revolution. There was a lot of energy usage, mainly coal usage. This often spewed pollutants into the air, causing people to become accustomed to seeing foggy, extremely polluted air. However, by 1952, the pollution had reached critical levels. Because the weather was so frigid that winter, people burnt more coal than normal to keep warm. As a result, the smoke, together with nitrogen oxides, soot, and sulphur dioxide, reached dangerously high levels, blanketing London in a black cloud of near-complete darkness, killing nearly 12,000 people.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAEiJDIKwlg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVT1tPkR-fUVlO652EcO3ow"">CBS Sunday Morning </a>",,,,,,
