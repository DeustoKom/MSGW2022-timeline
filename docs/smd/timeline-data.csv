,,,,,,,,,Worst environmental disasters caused by humans,"<p class='lead'>Humans have been responsible for some of the most catastrophic environmental occurrences in history. War, nuclear blasts, chemical spills, poisonous gas leaks, and oil spills are among the catastrophes. When these catastrophes happen, the environmental implications are severe, and the effects last for hundreds of years.</p>",,,,,title,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B5CE/production/_121024564_gettyimages-675938952_coalpower.jpg,

1952,12,5,,1952,12,9,,,The Londonâ€™s Killer Fog,"<p> London was one of the nations that influenced the industrialization market during the Industrial Revolution. There was a lot of energy usage, mainly coal usage. This often spewed pollutants into the air, causing people to become accustomed to seeing foggy, extremely polluted air. However, by 1952, the pollution had reached critical levels. Because the weather was so frigid that winter, people burnt more coal than normal to keep warm. As a result, the smoke, together with nitrogen oxides, soot, and sulphur dioxide, reached dangerously high levels, blanketing London in a black cloud of near-complete darkness, killing nearly 12,000 people. </p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAEiJDIKwlg,<a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVT1tPkR-fUVlO652EcO3ow'>CBS Sunday Morning </a>,A brief explanation of what happened in London,,,,,
1956,5,1,,1960,,,,,Minamata Disease,"<p> Residents of Minamata, a tiny seaside city in southern Japan, began to notice some unusual animal behaviour in the early 1950s. Birds would crash land and fish would mysteriously go belly up, while cats would froth at the lips, dance around furiously, and plunge themselves into the water. Humans soon developed what became known as Minamata Disease, slurring their speech, stumbling around, and having difficulty with simple actions like buttoning buttons. The perpetrator was ultimately discovered in 1959, when it was discovered that one of Minamata's largest companies, Chisso Corporation, was dumping mercury into the water as part of its production process, harming humans (and animals) who ate local fish. Chisso apparently continued to release mercury-tainted wastewater until 1968, causing at least 2,000 fatalities as well as birth deformities, paralysis, and other illnesses. </p>",,,,,,,,
1984,12,2,,1984,12,3,,,"Union Carbide Cyanide Gas Leak, Bhopal, India","<p> A Union Carbide India Limited pesticide facility in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, discharged a lethal chemical fog on December 3, 1984, killing over 5,000 people. They died as a result of isocyanate (pesticide) gas poisoning. More than 50,000 people were treated as a result of their exposure to the gas, while over 500,000 people were exposed. Proponents allege that the gas leak has resulted in the deaths of an additional 20,000 people since then. It is widely considered to be the greatest industrial chemical accident in history. </p>",https://twitter.com/bhopalmedappeal ,,,,,,,
1986,4,26,,,,,,,"The Nuclear Power Plant Explosion in Chernobyl, Ukraine","<p> The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant underwent a reactor shutdown on April 26, 1986. A runaway nuclear reaction resulted in a catastrophic fire and explosion, instantaneously killing 50 people and releasing 400 times the radiation produced by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The widespread dissemination of radioactive chemicals has been connected to almost 4000 cancer deaths. Belarus was severely impacted, with radioactive pollution found as far as the British Isles. The site's radiation levels remain high, and the number of nuclear items buried beneath the wreckage is unclear. </p>",https://soundcloud.com/user-601521000/nuclear-power-the-arrogance-of-man-revisiting-the-chernobyl-disaster-serhii-plokhii-41918?fbclid=IwAR2PqZmTO05_Y-2aKIQLlCMik_kNRIsxj4jMRqmRxhFPX0rwtCz7ggBFf20 ,,,,,,,
1989,3,24,,1992,,,,,The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill,"<p> The oil tanker Exxon Valdez spilt 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil in Prince William Sounds, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. The oil tanker collided with Bligh Reef, resulting in an accident. According to research, it is one of the most damaging human-caused environmental disasters, having long- and short-term consequences. Immediately, 100,000 to 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbour seals, 247 Bald Eagles, and 22 Orcas, as well as an undetermined quantity of salmon and herring, died. </p>",,,,,,,,
2000,1,30,,2000,2,2,,,Baia Mare Cyanide Spill,"<p> One of Europe's largest environmental disasters occurred on January 30, 2000. A cyanide spill in Baia Mare, Romania, caused the accident. 100,000 cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated trash spilled from a dam, dumping 100 tonnes of cyanide into the Somes, Tisza, and Danube rivers in huge numbers. A huge amount of aquatic life was lost. A large number of aquatic plants and fish died, and up to 100 people were hospitalised for poisoning-related diseases after eating infected seafood. Cyanide levels were found to be 300 to 700 times higher than pollution regulations. </p>","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turnul+Combinatului/@47.652822,23.605501,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf3c2ed5221d9777a!8m2!3d47.6529895!4d23.6053033?hl=en ",,,,,,,
2020,6,3,,,,,,,Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone,"<p> This is one of the infamous aquatic places that resulted from human activities. It is considered the United States' largest ""dead zone"" area. In the Gulf of Mexico Lifeless Zone, hundreds of fish are frequently observed floating dead. The constant dumping of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilisers in the region is the source of the ""dead zone."" The nutrients originate from the Mississippi River, which drains roughly half of continental America's nitrogen and phosphorus waste, as well as other nutrients. Plants and fish that live in the water cannot totally thrive in the region. </p>",,,,,,,,
