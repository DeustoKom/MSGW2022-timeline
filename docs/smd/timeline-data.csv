,,,,,,,,,Worst environmental disasters caused by humans,"<p class='lead'>Humans have been responsible for some of the most catastrophic environmental occurrences in history. War, nuclear blasts, chemical spills, poisonous gas leaks, and oil spills are among the catastrophes. When these catastrophes happen, the environmental implications are severe, and the effects last for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p>",,,,,title,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B5CE/production/_121024564_gettyimages-675938952_coalpower.jpg,
1919,,,,1990,,,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>Asbestos in Libby</span>        ,"<p> Since 1919, deadly asbestos dust from vermiculite mining in Libby, Montana, has killed 400 people and sickened nearly 3,000 more. In Libby, the mining corporation W.R. Grace and Co. had also disseminated vermiculite, which is commonly used as insulation in building construction, around playgrounds and backyards. The mine was closed in 1990, and the Environmental Protection Agency declared a public health emergency in 2008. </p>",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_disaster,Wikipedia,,,,,,#6f826d
1952,12,5,,1952,12,9,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>Londonâ€™s Killer Fog</span>,"<p>London was one of the nations that influenced the industrialization market during the Industrial Revolution. There was a lot of energy usage, mainly coal usage. This often spewed pollutants into the air, causing people to become accustomed to seeing foggy, extremely polluted air. However, by 1952, the pollution had reached critical levels. Because the weather was so frigid that winter, people burnt more coal than normal to keep warm. As a result, the smoke, together with nitrogen oxides, soot, and sulphur dioxide, reached dangerously high levels, blanketing London in a black cloud of near-complete darkness, killing nearly 12,000 people.</p> ",https://cdn.britannica.com/75/19375-050-C451A133/London-fog-1952.jpg,<a href='https://www.britannica.com'>Britannica</a>,,,,,,#6f826d
1956,5,1,,1960,,,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>Minamata Disease</span>,"<p> Residents of Minamata, a tiny seaside city in southern Japan, began to notice some unusual animal behaviour in the early 1950s. Birds would crash land and fish would mysteriously go belly up, while cats would froth at the lips, dance around furiously, and plunge themselves into the water. Humans soon developed what became known as Minamata Disease, slurring their speech, stumbling around, and having difficulty with simple actions like buttoning buttons. The perpetrator was ultimately discovered in 1959, when it was discovered that one of Minamata's largest companies, Chisso Corporation, was dumping mercury into the water as part of its production process, harming humans (and animals) who ate local fish. Chisso apparently continued to release mercury-tainted wastewater until 1968, causing at least 2,000 fatalities as well as birth deformities, paralysis, and other illnesses. </p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80KJ9gqHrYo,<a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5O114-PQNYkurlTg6hekZw'>United Nations </a>,Mr. Masami Ogata attempts to teach us about the mistakes made in Minamata so the lessons can be learnt,,,,,#6f826d

They died as a result of isocyanate (pesticide) gas poisoning. More than 50,000 people were treated as a result of their exposure to the gas, while over 500,000 people were exposed. Proponents allege that the gas leak has resulted in the deaths of an additional 20,000 people since then. It is widely considered to be the greatest industrial chemical accident in history. </p>",https://twitter.com/BhopalMedAppeal/status/1296817530779193347,,,,,,,#6f826d
1986,4,26,,1986,11,30,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>The Nuclear Power Plant Explosion in Chernobyl</span>,"<p> The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant underwent a reactor shutdown on April 26, 1986. A runaway nuclear reaction resulted in a catastrophic fire and explosion, instantaneously killing 50 people and releasing 400 times the radiation produced by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The widespread dissemination of radioactive chemicals has been connected to almost 4000 cancer deaths. Belarus was severely impacted, with radioactive pollution found as far as the British Isles. The site's radiation levels remain high, and the number of nuclear items buried beneath the wreckage is unclear. </p>",https://soundcloud.com/yarnpodcast/chernobyl,<a href='https://soundcloud.com/yarnpodcast'>Yarn | A Story Podcast</a>,,,,,,#6f826d
1989,3,24,,1992,,,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</span>,"<p> The oil tanker Exxon Valdez spilt 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil in Prince William Sounds, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. The oil tanker collided with Bligh Reef, resulting in an accident. According to research, it is one of the most damaging human-caused environmental disasters, having long- and short-term consequences. Immediately, 100,000 to 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbour seals, 247 Bald Eagles, and 22 Orcas, as well as an undetermined quantity of salmon and herring, died. </p>","<blockquote>The sound's coastal ecosystem is permanently damaged.

2000,1,30,,2000,2,2,,,<span style='color:#AEC2AC;'>Baia Mare Cyanide Spill</span>,"<p> One of Europe's largest environmental disasters occurred on January 30, 2000. A cyanide spill in Baia Mare, Romania, caused the accident. 100,000 cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated rubbish spilled from a dam, dumping 100 tonnes of cyanide into the Somes, Tisza, and Danube rivers in huge numbers. A huge amount of aquatic life was lost. A large number of aquatic plants and fish died, and up to 100 people were hospitalised for poisoning-related diseases after eating infected seafood. Cyanide levels were found to be 300 to 700 times higher than pollution regulations. </p>","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turnul+Combinatului/@47.652822,23.605501,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf3c2ed5221d9777a!8m2!3d47.6529895!4d23.6053033?hl=en ",,,,,,,#6f826d

It is considered the United States' largest ""dead zone"" area. In the Gulf of Mexico Lifeless Zone, hundreds of fish are frequently observed floating dead. The constant dumping of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilisers in the region is the source of the ""dead zone."" The nutrients originate from the Mississippi River, which drains roughly half of continental America's nitrogen and phosphorus waste, as well as other nutrients. Plants and fish that live in the water can't thrive in the region. </p>",https://rss.art19.com/episodes/86b57b7c-6b18-4d24-8c55-86d5975ea4b7.mp3,Weather Geeks,"Dr. Tracy Fanara is a scientist and engineer who speaks about the Gulf of Mexico, explaining that similar occurrences can happen elsewhere in the world if the conditions are appropriate.",,,,,#6f826d
